# Real-Estate-App

Real-Estate-App is a react-based application that is designed to act as a
template that people trying to get into the real-estate market can use. This
application is a mockup of the realestate-app.jpg file seen in the repo.


## Current Progress
Currently, this application is solely react-based with no backend support. I am
working on integrating a node/express API that stores data in a mongodb storage.
